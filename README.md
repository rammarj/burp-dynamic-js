# burp-dynamic-js
Plugin for Burp Suite Free wich detects dynamic JS generated on the server side

## Introduction
Server side generated javascript can contain useful information, or even secrets.

This plugin helped me som time to find real bugs in Alibaba and I reported them v√≠a their BBP.

## Setup
Download the jar file located in the releases section and import it in the extender option of burp suite. For more information about how to use extender option see the [official documentation](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/tools/extender#loading-and-managing-extensions)

## Local compilation
If you want to compile the code yourself, you need to have [maven](https://maven.apache.org/) installed and run the following command in the base directory of the project:
```console
$ mvn clean install
```

## Contibuting
Feel free to create an issue or a pull request if you see any bugs or need to add a new kind of PoC
